# CARMAcloud

## Documentation
CARMAcloud provides some of the infrastructure components for CARMA. It enables users to define geofences, rules of practice, replay storms to test weather-related rules of practice, as well as monitor CARMA-enabled vehicles and the messages and controls exchanged with them.

## Deployment
CARMAcloud can be deployed on a Linux server running the Debian Operating System by executing the following commands:
```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/kruegersp/cc.git
sudo -u root apt-get update && sudo -u root apt-get install pkg-config sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
wget https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.1.tar.gz && tar -xzf proj-6.1.1.tar.gz && mv proj-6.1.1 proj
cd /tmp/proj && ./configure && make && sudo -u root make install
cd /tmp/cc/src/cc/geosrv && gcc -c -std=c11 -fPIC -Wall -I /usr/local/openjdk-11/include/ -I /usr/local/openjdk-11/include/linux/ -I /tmp/proj/src/ cs2cswrapper.c && gcc -shared -lproj cs2cswrapper.o -o libcs2cswrapper.so && sudo -u root mv *.so /usr/lib
cd /tmp && wget http://apache.mirrors.lucidnetworks.net/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.26/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.26.tar.gz && tar -xzf apache-tomcat-9.0.26.tar.gz && mv apache-tomcat-9.0.26 tomcat
find ./cc/src -name "*.java" > sources.txt && mkdir -p tomcat/webapps/carmacloud/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes
javac -cp tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar:cc/lib/commons-compress-1.18.jar:cc/lib/javax.json.jar:cc/lib/protobuf-javalite-3.8.0-rc-1.jar -d tomcat/webapps/carmacloud/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes @sources.txt
sed -i '/<\/Engine>/ i \ \ \ \ \  <Host name="carmacloud" appBase="webapps/carmacloud" unpackWARs="false" autoDeploy="false">\n      </Host>' tomcat/conf/server.xml 
echo -e '127.0.0.1\tcarmacloud' | sudo -u root tee -a /etc/hosts
java -cp tomcat/webapps/carmacloud/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/:tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar cc.ws.UserMgr ccadmin admin_testpw > tomcat/webapps/carmacloud/user.csv
sudo -u root mv tomcat /opt/
```
These commands will download the CARMAcloud source code from github, necessary dependencies, and the tomcat webserver. Changes to the tomcat version might be necessary if version 9.0.26 is no longer available on the apache mirror. Next the java code will be compiled and the .class files will be placed in the correct directory. Tomcat's server.xml file will have the carmacloud host entry inserted in the correct location. Carmacloud will be added to the /etc/hosts file. The java command that runs cc.ws.UserMgr will create the ccadmin user for the system. It is suggested to change to password to something more secure by replacing "admin_testpw" with the desired password in the command.
## Configuration
The Tomcat webserver must be configured to run on the deployment server. Click [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/index.html) to find the documentation for Tomcat. There are many configuration items to considered but two that must be addressed for any deployment are adding the domain name and SSL Certificate to the server.xml file. Proper security measures dealing with file permissions should be taken as well. According to Tomcat's [documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/security-howto.html#System_Properties) a tomcat user and group should be created in the operating system. The standard configuration for file permissions is to have all Tomcat files owned by root with group tomcat. Owner should have read/write permissions, group should have read permission, and world has no permissions. The exceptions are the logs, temp and work directory that are owned by the tomcat user rather than root. Additional users can be added to CARMAcloud by run the following command and replacing <username> and <password> with the desired user name and password respectively:
```
java -cp tomcat/webapps/carmacloud/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/:tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar cc.ws.UserMgr <username> <password> >> /opt/tomcat/webapps/carmacloud/user.csv
```
Once everything is configured for the deployment, the following command can be ran to start the application:
```
sudo -u tomcat /opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh start
```
